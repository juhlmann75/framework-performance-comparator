# Documentation

General extra documentation in /docs in additon to README.md. We could look to use some other docuemntation standard in future, but for now, using markdown.

## Reporting

Goals:

- html eventual output (so can be viewed in browser) - based on using csv output
- ability to see multiple tests together in some nice graph form so can be easily comparable

Did a quick test of https://github.com/benc-uk/k6-reporter, not planning to use this, but here is an output example: [k6-reporter-summary-example.html](k6-reporter-summary-example.html)
